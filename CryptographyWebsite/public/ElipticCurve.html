    <h1> Overview</h1>
    <p> 
        Elliptic Curves are used mostly in public key cryptography. The elliptic curve comes in the form 
        y^2 = x^3 + A*x where A and B are constants. You can then mod the result by a number P and work form there. 
        Elliptic Curves are one of the most secure methods right now but are at risk of being solved quantum computing.
        Fun Fact: The block chain uses elliptic curve cryptography for their crypto system(the last one covered on this page).
    </p>
    <P>
      <img src="https://www.globalsign.com/application/files/4916/0389/7496/Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography.png" alt="elliptic curve">
        The bases for an elliptic curve encryption come from the fact that an elliptic curve is symmetric and that if you have two points 
        you can draw a line throw the two points and get a third point even if the two points are the same point. Most algorithms are 
        going to use some sort of point addition and point multiplication. The point addition is either creating an ll variable that is equal 
        to (y2 - y1) * (x2-x1)^-1 mod p (based on the distance formal) if the points are different or ll variable is equal to (3*x1^2 + A) * (2*y1)^-1 mod p if adding the same points.
        This algorithm is then used in multiplication such that x * P(some point) is equal to another point. This is usually done with a 
        double and add algorithm. This algorithm works by having a starting point and a number you want to multiply by. 
        These are then used in a while loop that checks to see if n%2 =1, if it is you add your point R and a point Q, if Q is not set yet, it is 
        your starting point R, and setting the result equal to R. After the calculations, you set Q equal to Q+Q using the add algorithm, n is then divided by 2 (taking the floor of the result)
        and starting the loop again. <br>
        <br>
        these algorithms look like:<br><br>
        <div class="example">
    if (x1 == x2 and y1 == y2):<br>
        ____ll = ((3*x1^2 + A)*inverse_mod(2*y1,p))%p<br>
    else:<br>
       ____ ll = ((y2 - y1)*inverse_mod(x2 - x1,p))%p<br>
    x3 = (ll^2 - x1 - x2)%p<br>
    y3 = (ll*(x1 - x3) - y1)%p<br>
    return (x3 , y3)<br><br>
    above is a part of a elliptic curve point addition algorithm.<br><br>
    while (n > 0):<br>
_if n%2 == 1:<br>
   ___ R = ECaddP(A,B,p,R,Q)<br>
_Q = ECaddP(A,B,p,Q,Q)<br>
_n = floor(n/2)<br><br>
</div>
return R<br>
above is a snip of the point multiplication written in sage(based in python). Q = P to begin with, P is the point you are trying to multiple, and n is how many times you 
want to multiply it. ECaddP is elliptic curve addition function call.
    </P>

    <h2>Diffie-Hellman</h2>
    <P>
      You can use the elliptic curve to do the Diffie Hellman shared key generator in a slightly different way. 
      This way is more secure because it is harder to solve the discreet log problem on an elliptic curve than it is 
      with polynomials. <br>
      The encryption works by starting with a shared elliptic curve and a shared prime as well as a point that is shared. 
      Bob and Alice (receiver and sender) going to come up with a private key for each that is not shared and use their key to multiple 
      the shared point and share that. Then they are going to use their private keys to multiple the swapped points to get a share point.
    </P>
    <h4>
      Example
    </h4>
    <p class="example">
      Y^2=X^3 +9X +5 mod 13<br>
      P = (4,1)<br>
      secret keys -> a = 2 and b = 4<br>
      2P = (8,2)  and  4P = (9,3)<br> 
      swap keys <br>
      2(9,3) = (4,12) and 4(8,2) = 2(9,3) = (4,12)<br><br>
      As you can see both Alice and Bob have a shared key!

    </p>
    <h2>ElGamal Public key</h2> 
    <p>
      The ElGamal elliptic curve is based on ElGamal public key exchange but is converted into an elliptic curve. The main difference 
      is that this system is more secure due to elliptic curves buying a lot harder to solve for than either factoring or solving a 
      discreet log problem, even if it based on discreet log problems. This system works by have an agreed on elliptic curve, prime p used 
      to module the curve, and a point P. Alice is then going to come up with some number na and is going to use that to multiply 
      P by it to get Q. Alice sends Q over to Bob. Bob come up with a k and a point M which is the message and computes c1 = k*P and 
      c2 = M+k*Q. Bob sends c1 and c2 back to Alice. Alice can use the inverse of na to find the M by c1*na^-1 +c2 = M.
    </p>
    <h4>Example </h4>
    <p class="example">
      public information <br>
      Y^2 = X^3+13X+37 mod 7331<br>
      P=(101,6124)<br><br>

      Alice<br>
      private key: 123 = na<br>
      public key: 123*(101,6124) = (6884,150) = Q<br><br>

      Bob<br>
      private key: 137 = k<br>
      private message: (313,2634) = M<br>
      c1 = k*P = 137*(101,6124) =(3107,624)<br>
      c2 = M + k*Q = (313,2634) + 137*(6884,150) = (2761,3470)<br>
      c1 and c2 are sent to Alice <br><br>

      Alice decryption<br>
      c2+c1*-na = (2761,3470)+(3107,624)123^-1 = (313,2634) <br> <br>

      As you can see Alice got the private message that Bob came up with.
      Some things to note, M has to be a valid point on the curve 
      and so does P. 
    </p>
    <h2>Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</h2>
    <P> This is the encryption algorithm that bitcoin and 
      Ethereum use to show ownership the currency. This is based off the 
      DSA algorithm which was not covered on this website. A digital signature is a few extra 
      bits of information added to some document that can be verified to show 
      that you either own it or that it is a legitimate document.<br>
      The algorithm:
      <div class="example">
      <ul>
        <li>starts with an elliptic curve mod p that has an order Q (Q is prime) </li>
        <li>Get a point G on the curve, G is public</li>
        <li> G*Q gets you a point at infinity(cycle)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Alice</li>
        <li>is then going to create a signing key s</li>
        <li>create point V = s*G</li>
        <li>create a document d < Q</li>
        <li>create one time key e < Q</li>
        <li>e*G is calculated</li>
        <li>s1 = x mod Q, x being the x from e*G</li>
        <li> s2 = (d *s *s1) e^-1 mod  Q</li>
        <li>send s1,s2,V, and d to Bob</li>
      </ul> 
      <ul>
        <li>Bob:</li>
        <li>makes v1 = d *s2^-1 mod  Q</li>
        <li>makes v2 = s1 *s2^-1 mod  Q</li>
        <li> Pos Valid=G*v1 + V*v2 </li>
        <li>if the x value of Pos Valid mod Q is the s1 value, it is valid</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <!-- starts with an eleptic curve mod p that has an order Q, Q being prime 
      and order in this context is the amount of times a certain point can be added to itself to 
      get a point at infity, i.e the end of a cycle. Then there is going to be 
      a point G that is known. Alice is then going to create 
      a signing key s and create point V = s*G. Alice then 
      creates a document d and a one time key e both less than the order of Q.
      e*G is calculates the x from that is used to calculate
      s1 = x mod order Q, then with s1 we calculate s2 = (d *s *s1) e^-1 mod q(q being order of Q).
      Alice then sends s1,s2,V, and d to Bob. Bob makes a v1 and v2,
      v1 = d *s2^-1 mod q and v2 = s1 *s2^-1 mod q. Bob then calculates 
      G*v1 + V*v2 and if the x mod q is equal to s1, it is a 
      good signature. -->
    </P>
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p class="example">
      public:<br>
      y^2 = x^3 +13x+37 mod 7331<br>
      q=101<br>
      G=(6851,1963)<br><br>

      Alice:<br>
      s=42<br>
      s*G = V=(3637,1716)<br>
      d =42 <br>
      e=11 <br>
      e*g = (2710,5987)<br>
      s1 =2710 mod 101 = 84<br>
      s2 = (d+s*s1) e^-1 mod q = (42+42*84) 11^-1 mod q = 95<br>
      Alice sends s1, s2, d, and V to Bob<br><br>

      Bob:<br>
      v1 = d* s2^-1 mod q <br>
      v2 = s1 *s2^-1 mod q <br>
      G*v1 + V*v2 = (2701, 4566) + (4894,125) -> grab x <br>
      x mod q = 84 =s1  <br><br>
      Since our x value from G*v1 +V*v2 is equal to the 
      s1 that Alice sent, that means the signature is valid. 
      The numbers are relatively low and is easy to brute force 
      your way into getting the s value, allowing you to forge
      signatures but NIST has recomondations for curves that 
      would mitigate this.
