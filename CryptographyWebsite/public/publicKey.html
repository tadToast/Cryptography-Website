    <h1> Overview</h1>
    <p> 
       There are two people involved, one is the sender the other is the receiver, and the sender is going 
       to send the receiver public keys that are generated from private keys that no one else should know.
        The receiver will then add there message in some way and send it back to the sender and the sender 
        can get the message. That is the general format for a public key exchange algorithm. You would 
        use a public key exchange, also known as an asymmetric key exchange, when there is no prier relationship 
        set up.
    </p>
    <h2>Knapsack Algorithms</h2>
    <P>
        The first generalized public key exchange is Knapsack, which was created in 1978. The way the 
        exchange works is that the sender in this is going to have a list of supersending numbers 
        such as {1,2,4,8,16,32}. supersending numbers are a list of numbers that each entry is bigger than 
        all the previous entries added up. The sender then comes up with public key m and n. m is the number
        that you are going to use for modulus, and m must be bigger than all numbers in the list added up,
        so, for our example, it would have to be bigger than 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63. The number n is going to
        be the value we multiple all values in our list by. Then, once we have out n and m, we multiply each
        entry in the list by n and then mod it by m.
    </P>
    <h4>example</h4>
    <p class="example">
      list: {1,2,4,8,16,32} m:67  n:24
      <br><br>
      1*24 mod 67 = 24 <br>
      2*24 mod 67 = 48<br>
      4*24 mod 67 = 29<br>
      8*24 mod 67 = 58<br>
      16*24 mod 67 = 49<br>
      32*24 mod 67 = 31<br><br>
      Public Key knapsack = {24,48,29,58,49,31}

    </p>
    <P>
      The next part of the process would be to encrypt our message. If our message is 100110111001001100 in binary, then we would have to the message
      evenly in order to encrypt it. So, it would turn into 100110 111001 001100 so that we can encrypt it with our public key by 
      using the numbers that correspond to a position where a 1 is at and at them together.</body>p>

      <p class="example">
      100110 = 24 + 58 + 49 = 131<br>
      111001 = 24 + 48 + 29 +31= 132 <br>
      001100 = 29 + 58 = 87 <br>
      This mean our cypher text is 131,132,87
    </P>
    <p>
      The receiver is going to get m and n as well as the cypher text and if they are a trusted user, they have the private key already.
      In order to decrypt our message we need to be able to find the inverse of n mod m, i.e. n * some number = 1 mod m.
      There are a few ways to find the inverse of a number, one being the extended euclidean algorithm, but most calculators and programing languages 
      can find the inverse of a number easily, so I am not going to write out all steps on how to get an inverse.
      In the example case we have been working with, 24 * 14 mod 67 = 1, thus the inverse of n is 14.<br>
      With the inverse we can decrypt our the cypher text into addition of the original private key of {1,2,4,8,16,32}.</html>p>

      <p class="example">

        131*14mod 67 = 25 = 16+8+1 = 100110<br>
        132*14mod 67 = 39 = 32+4+2+1 = 111001<br>
        87*14mod 67 = 12 = 8+4 = 001100<br><br>
        As you can see, this is the orginal message before
        being encrypted. In this example, you did not need the private
        key, if you found the inverse of n, you could have solved for the private key 
        like the above way.

    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make a secure knapsack, you need a list of the size of at least 250 and each item should 
      be between 200-400 bits long and the m should be about 100-200 bits long. Most real implementations of 
      this algorithm uses random numbers for these values. If someone were to try solve by brute force with the
      method mentioned, it would take till the heat death of the universe to solve, even in parallel.<br>
      This is one of the only public key exchanges that is able to hold its own against quantum computing 
      since it does not rely on  factoring large integers or computing discrete logarithms. It is not used 
      very much but it could still be used. 
    </p>
    <h2>RSA</h2>
    <P>
        Named after the three inventors- Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, RSA is a public key
        exchange that has withstood the test of times and has been used since 1977. RSA security is based
        the number you use to modulo your data since the number is a factor of two large prime numbers, 
        and since it is hard to factor the numbers, you have security in you number.<br>
        The way a message is encrypted is by first choosing your n to be a factor two large primes 
        that are close together, to make it harder to try and factor. Then you split your message into blocks 
        smaller than your n and then raise each of those blocks to a some power less than n and modulo them n.
        the cypher is message^ some number mod n.<br>
        The receiver can decrypt the message if he know the exponent since the receiver can find 
        the inverse of the exponent and raise the cypher text to it and ge the original message back.
    </P>
    <h4> example</h4>
    <p class="example">
      p = 71   q=47 (both are prime)<br>
      n= p*q = 3337<br>
      (p-1) *(q-1)  = 70*46 = 3220 our exponent should not have a common factor with 3220<br>
      e = 79  and 79 has no common factor with 3220<br>
      d = e^-1 mod (p-1)*(q-1)<br>
      d = 79^-1 mod 3220 = 1019<br>
      message =688232687<br><br>
      encryption<br><br>
      m1= 688<br>
      m2 = 232<br>
      m3 = 687<br>
      c1 = m1 ^ e mod n = 688^79 mod 3337 = 1570<br>
      c2 = m2 ^ e mod n = 232^79 mod 3337 = 2756<br>
      c3 = m3 ^ e mod n = 687^79 mod 3337 = 2091<br>
      c = 1570 2756 2091 <br><br>
      decryption<br><br>
      c1 ^d mod n = m1 = 1570^1019 mod 3337 = 688 <br>
      c2 ^d mod n = m2 = 2756^1019 mod 3337 = 232 <br>
      c3 ^d mod n = m3 = 2091^1019 mod 3337 = 687 <br>
    </p>
    <P>
      As you can see, if we did not know how to factor n, this would be harder to solve.
      The security is the fact that n is hard to factor and that if can not factor it,
      you can not decrypt it because you need p-1 and q-1 in order to find the inverse of
      e. You can still use this system and NIST has recommended n's that you should use 
      but they are huge numbers. To be secure, s needs to be at least 2048 bits long according to NIST.<br>
      there were two offsets that came from RSA that became known after this, One is Pohlig Hellman encryption 
      and the other is Rabin's scheme. Pohlig Hellman is the same thing as RSA except in the information
      that is shared. Pohlig does not share the n as part of the public key, this leads to a difficult problem
      of e = logp(C) mod n with C being the cypher text. Rabin scheme had its primes be equal to 
      3 mod 4 and they are still prime, and then the message is always squared. Because of P and Q being 
      prime and equal to 3 mod 4, you can not solve it simply and instead have to work out a Chinese remainder 
      theorem problem where you have 4 possible answer per bit of message. decryption looks a little like: </p>
      <p class="example">
      possible m = C^(p-1/4)mod p<br> 
      possible m =p-C^(p-1/4)mod p<br> 
      possible m =q-C^(q-1/4)mod q<br> 
      possible m =q-C^(q-1/4)mod q<br> 
      <br> Then you have to find the inverse of p and q and make an a and a b variable 
      being a = p*(p^-1 mod q) and b = q*(q^-1 mod p). Once you have those, you can find your 
      actual possible m. <br><br>
      pos M1 = (a*m1 + b*m3)mod n<br>
      pos M1 = (a*m1 + b*m4)mod n<br>
      pos M1 = (a*m2 + b*m3)mod n<br>
      pos M1 = (a*m2 + b*m4)mod n<br><br>
      It is not a fast process but it is relatively secure depending on the numbers used.
    </P>
    <h2>ElGamal</h2>
    <p>
      ElGamal is an asymmetric key encryption. The difficulty of this system comes from 
      finding discrete logarithm in a cycle group, a cycle group is all numbers that can come from a modulo,
      that is even if we know g^a and g^b, it is difficult to compute g^ab.<br>
      The way the encryption works is that a q is going come up with a number q with a cycle F.
      He is going to choose two numbers a and b from the cycle group F such that the
      greatest common factor of a and q is 1, meaning that they are coprime. Then the public key is
      is b^a, F,q and b and leaving a to be private. This is what the recever is going to do before
      any encryption is done.<br><br>
      The sender is going to select an element k from F such that the greatest common factor of
      k and q is 1. Then the sender gets a p = b^k and 
      s = b^ak. The message M is then multiplied by s and send out
      p,M*s = b^k, M* b^ak<br><br>
      The receiver is then going to calculate p^a = 
      g^ak and then devides the message M*s by g^ak 
      which will get you just the message M since 
      s = g^ak<br><br>
      This system is similar to RSA but relies on discreet log being hard 
      compared to RSA relying on factoring to be hard.
