        The point of this website is to show off some of the crypto systems out there and to inform on the
        algorithms involved in them. This website will only cover a few of the big algorithms and will try to provide
        an example of each. Some of the more modern systems are going to be hard to understand but hopefully each explanation
        can be understood.

        Most examples were created by me but some are from other people, mostly in the quantum tab. Each page has all sources used to
        create the page. I do not explain every aspect on how each example works, but let it be known that generally the covered systems
        work because we can find an inverse of what we did. For example, you can find an inverse for certain numbers modulo a number
        and you can find the inverse of some matrix given it has an inverse(not all matrices are invertible).
        I would also like to thank Mark Spanier for helping me with some of the crypto systems and giving me good
        resources to explore.
