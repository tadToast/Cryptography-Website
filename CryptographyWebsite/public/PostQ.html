    <h1> Overview</h1>
    <p class="info"> 
        Post Quantum cryptography is fairly new in terms of cryptography and has had most of its improvements done in the 
        late 2010's. Most of the systems came about due to a competition that NIST hosted starting around 2017 to find the quantum proof cryptosystem.
        The way each one of the systems is going to work is going to be based on linear algebra ideas as well as a 
        new data structure called a lattice, named after the knitting technique. A lattice is kind of similar to how 
        an elliptic curve works in the way that it is just a series of points based of some type of polynomial, but the 
        difference is how they are going to be used. Most of the lattice-based systems are going to have their encryption based on 
        placing a message into a point and slightly offsetting it, this allows the other person to know where the message is and 
        it is incredibly hard for an interceptor to find the point that has the message.<br><br>
        A lattice can be represented as a matrix times some vector and all results would be the lattice. In a 2D lattice with a 2x2 matrix A,
        you could visualize all points as some combination of scalars a and b times columns of A<br>

    With a and b being the elements of the vector.
    <br> The lattice of this would be 
    all possible combinations of the above function. What is done in the crypto system is 
    that a secret key is going to be used to go to a specific point 
    and the other person is going to add their message to secret key (the point) 
    and then the person who knows the secret key can then uncover the message. It is hard 
    to find the secret key because in order to find it, you would have to solve to find 
    the closest point which is extremely hard when the points 
    are close together.

    <h2>NTRU</h2>
    <P class="info">
       NTRU is a runner up in the competition that NIST hosted that ran for years and had 4 rounds of filtering. NTRU is a 
       cryptosystem that relies on linear algebra facts and is a public key cryptosystem like RSA(the most used public key system). 
       The NTRU system starts with an Alice that has a public p and q, both are integers and q should be a lot larger than p for security. Then Alice 
       is going to come up with some polynomial function f (x^7 +x^3 + x +1 ) with degree N-1, degree being the largest power in the polynomial 
       function. Some things to note about f is that it needs to be invertible mod p and q, i.e. f*another polynomial function = 1 mod p and q. 
       Alice will then compute fp which is the inverted f mod p, i.e. f *fp mod p = 1, and fq which is the inverted f mod q. She then 
       chooses some other polynomial g with the same degree as f. Alice makes a public key h = g*fp mod q. So far what is public is N (degree of polynomial)
       p and q(used for modulus), and public key h, that means fp, fq, g, and f. Bob is then going to come up with a message M which is a 
       polynomial function and some random polynomial r. Bob will then compute the encryption variable e = (p*r *h +m )mod q. the 
       e variable is sent back to Alice. Alice computes variable a = e*f mod q, then a*fp mod p = M 
       
    </P>
    <h4> Example </h4>
    <p class="example">
      Alice:<br>
      N=7 p =3 q=41 <br>
      f= x^6+x^3 +x^2 -1<br> 
      g = x^6 + x^4 - x^2 -x<br> 
      fp = x^6 + 2x^5 +x^3 +x^2 +x +1 <br>
      fq = 8x^6 + 26X^5 +31x^4 +21x^3 +40x^2 +2x +37 <br>
      h = g*fp mod q =19x^6 + 38x^5 +6x^4 +32x^3 +24x^2 +37x +8 <br>
      send h,p,q, and N<br><br>

      Bob: <br>
      M = -x^5 +x^3 +x^2 -x +1<br>
      r = x^6 -x^5 +x -1 <br>
      e = p*r*h + m mod q = 31*x^5 + 19*x^5 +4*x^4 +2*x^3 +40*x^2 +3*x +25 <br><br>

      Alice:<br>
      a = e* f mod q = x^6 +10*x^5 - 8*x^4 -x^3 -x^2 +x -1 <br>
      fp*a mod p = -x^5 +x^3 +x^2 -x +1<br><br>
    </p><p class="info">
      Above you can see that Alice 
      has got the message. Some things to note 
      is that this process can fail depending on the 
      format and numbers used, so fail safe bits 
      should be added to the passes 
      between Alice and Bob. 
     </p>
     <h2>CRYSTALS Kyber</h2>
     <p class="info">
      CRYSTALS kyber, also known as kyber, is a crypto system that relies on using matrix's 
      with polynomials in them and then using some vector with polynomials in it to find a new 
      vector that is going to be used to encrypt. A matrix is a rows * columns sized data structure 
      that has a set of data in each row column combination, in our case a polynomial function. A vector is 
      a rows by 1 column data structure that you can use to multiple a matrix in order to reduce its size into 
      a rows by 1 collom data structure (vector). Kyber and Dithorium are the NIST supported post quantum methods
      that shows in the competition. <br><br>

      This algorithm works by first generating some sort of small 
      polynomial function s, small in the way the numbers in front of each variable 
      is reltivly small, whcih is going to be our private key.
      We are going to need a q in which we will use for modulo later. 
      Next to generate the public key, we need a Matrix A 
      which is made up of polynomial equations  and we need a vector 
      t. To make our vector t, we need to make a small 
      error vector e. We will then make t by t= A*s +e. 
      What this does is turns our matrix into a vector, and then 
      we add a little error to the vector to make it harder to solve.
      So our private stuff is our s, and e and the public key is the A matrix 
      and the vector t (also the modulo variable q).<br><br>

      The encryption works by first having two polynomial vectors 
      e1 and r, e1 being another error vector and r being 
      a random polynomial vector. Then we need an e2 which is a polynomial 
      error equation. Then we get out message by turning what we want to send into 
      a polynomial equation from binary representation, i.e. 1011 = 1*x^3 + 0*x^2 +1*x +1.
      Then we are going to make the equation bigger by multiplying our message by 
      q/2, i.e q/2 x^3 +q/2x +q/2. Then the cypher u = A^T(transpose) *r +e1 and v = t^t*r +e2 + m 
      is created and sent over to be uncoded.<br><br>

      With v and u you can do v-s^T * u =Mn. now 
      we check each number in front of each of the x to see 
      if it is closer to q,0, or q/2. If the number is closer 
      to q or 0, turn that spot into a zero else turn it into a 1/2. 
      Then factor out the q/2 and the inside of the polynomial should 
      be the binary message.<br>
       i.e. q/2 = 5 5x^4 + 0x^3 +3x^2 + 8x +7 -> 5x^4 + 0x^3 + 5x^2 +0x +5 -> 5*(1*x^4 +1*x^2 + 1) -> 10101

      These numbers are extremely low, but they show the process. 
      This might look like it is a lot of steps, but it can be done 
      very fast by computers and does not take up that much space. 
      For a comparison, elliptic curve crypto is the most storage 
      efficient and is very fast and this algorithm can be performed 
      faster than an elliptic curve system and takes up less space while 
      also offering more bits of security.
